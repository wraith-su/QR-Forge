# QR-Forge

A small, no-nonsense QR code generator built as a quick side project.

This is a minimal static website for generating QR codes.  
The original goal was to put together something functional and clean in under an hour — which, unsurprisingly, took a bit longer.

There is nothing particularly groundbreaking here. The project intentionally sticks to the basics and avoids unnecessary abstractions or overengineering. The focus was on keeping the code straightforward, readable, and free of noise.

---

## Overview

- Simple QR code generation
- Minimal UI (like apple)
- No frameworks
- No build step
- No backend logic

The implementation relies on plain JavaScript and basic markup. Apart from two icon variants (added mostly for experimentation), everything else is kept as simple as possible.

---

## Why this exists

Mostly boredom.

I wanted to see how far a clean, usable solution could go with the bare minimum:
- no libraries unless strictly necessary
- no clever tricks
- no hidden complexity

The result is intentionally boring in the best possible way.

---

## Technical notes

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Default HTML/CSS
- No dependencies
- No tracking
- No API calls :)

The codebase is small on purpose. Everything is kept explicit and easy to reason about. Any unnecessary clutter was removed during development.

---

## Possible improvements

There is plenty of room for expansion if someone wants to take this further:
- more QR configuration options
- better accessibility
- export formats
- performance tweaks
- UI refinements

None of that was the goal here, but the structure should be flexible enough to support it.

## Disclaimer

This project is not meant to be a full-featured QR solution or a production-ready tool.  
It is simply a small, focused experiment.

If parts of it are useful to someone else — great.
